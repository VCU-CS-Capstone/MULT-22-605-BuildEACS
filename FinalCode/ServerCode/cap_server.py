#Server side test program
#Will await connection from client side
#Once connection is made, will read in data sent from client,
#data should consist of member id number. We can get ip address from the tcp packet
#using that data we will run the query on the ip address to get the cert needed
#and will then check to see if that user had that cert. 
#if so, we send true back to client, false if not.
